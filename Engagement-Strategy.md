# Stakeholder Involvement Plan

## Identified Stakeholders

| Stakeholder         | Role                        | Engagement Type             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Development Team    | Planning and implementation | Daily collaboration         |
| Instructor          | Advisor                     | Weekly check-ins            |
| Target Users        | Elderly / caregivers        | Assumed via user stories    |

## Engagement Strategy

- All team progress and contributions tracked via GitHub
- Weekly deliverables summarized in markdown reports
- Instructor feedback applied after midpoint progress review
- No external users were directly involved, but empathy-based design used

## Communication Tools

- WhatsApp (daily)
- GitHub Issues (asynchronous)
- Google Meet (for review alignment)
