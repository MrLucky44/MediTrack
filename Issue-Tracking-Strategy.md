# Issue Tracking Strategy

## GitHub Setup

- Used GitHub Issues for daily task assignment
- Labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `frontend`, `backend`, `high-priority`
- Each member assigned 10 unique issues with their name
- Pull Requests required at least 1 approval

## Review Process

1. Issue created with checklist and description
2. Assigned to developer
3. PR opened referencing the issue (e.g., `Fixes #14`)
4. Reviewer (another team member) approves
5. PR merged into `main`

## Weekly Stats

- 30 issues in total
- Avg. time to close an issue: 1.8 days
- No open issues remaining at final delivery
