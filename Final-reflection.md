# Final Reflection â€“ Ali Kerem Erhan

Working on MediTrack was an insightful experience. As the frontend developer and UI designer, I gained valuable experience in component-based mobile development and responsive interface design. One of the most challenging yet rewarding aspects was integrating the React Native frontend with the backend API, especially ensuring that push notifications displayed properly on various devices.

I learned how to structure tasks more effectively using GitHub Issues and how communication tools like WhatsApp and Meet can compensate for physical absence in a team project. I also became more confident in designing with accessibility in mind, as medication reminders often cater to older users.

This project gave me hands-on insight into real-world software project workflows and helped me prepare for future mobile-based healthcare solutions.
