# Work Environment Issues

## Team Structure

The team worked fully remotely, coordinating over WhatsApp and GitHub. Meetings were scheduled as needed using Google Meet.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Time zone mismatch**: Team members worked in different cities.
- **Limited device access**: Only one real Android device was available.
- **Lack of synchronous availability**: Often resulted in slower integration phases.
- **Notification testing complexity**: Firebase testing required real device access and token management.

## Solutions Applied

- Used emulators and simulators for frontend testing
- Documented integration endpoints clearly to work asynchronously
- Held 3 structured virtual meetings to align development milestones
